# GENEWISE

GENEWISE is an AI-powered web application that predicts rare diseases based on gene variant data. Designed for clinicians, geneticists, and researchers, GENEWISE leverages advanced machine learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models to analyze genomic data and provide accurate disease predictions, variant classifications, and actionable insights.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧬 Input raw patient gene data (e.g., VCF, gene variants)
- 🤖 AI-powered gene variant classification
- 🧠 RAG-based disease prediction using custom knowledge base
- 📊 Vector database integration for efficient data retrieval
- 🧾 Clinically-relevant recommendations based on analysis
- 🔍 Transparent and interpretable AI decisions
- 💻 User-friendly web interface for ease of use

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **AI/ML:** 
  - Custom LLM (Large Language Model) for gene interpretation
  - Gene variant classifier
- **Database:** 
  - Relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- **Deployment:** Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Input:** Clinicians upload or input patient-specific genetic variant data.
2. **Variant Classification:** The system uses AI to classify variants based on known patterns and annotations.
3. **Disease Prediction:** A custom-trained LLM with a connected vector knowledge base predicts potential rare diseases.
4. **Recommendation Output:** Users receive a detailed report with predicted diseases, variant interpretation, and suggested clinical actions.
